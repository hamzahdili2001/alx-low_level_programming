# C Programming

C is a general-purpose programming language that was developed in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It is a high-level language that is used for developing operating systems, database systems, compilers, and various other applications. C is a compiled language, which means that the source code is compiled into machine code before it can be run.

## What can you do with C?

C is a versatile language that can be used to build a wide variety of applications. Here are just a few examples:

- Operating systems: C is the language of choice for building operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- System software: C is also used for developing system software like device drivers, firmware, and utilities.
- Embedded systems: C is commonly used in embedded systems like medical devices, industrial automation systems, and smart home devices.
- Game development: C is used extensively in game development for writing game engines, physics engines, and graphics libraries.

## How does C work?

C is a compiled language, which means that the source code is compiled into machine code before it can be run. The C compiler takes the source code and translates it into a language that the computer can understand, which is typically machine code or assembly language. The resulting program can then be executed directly by the computer's processor.

## About Betty Style

Betty Style is a set of guidelines for writing C code that was created by Holberton School. The guidelines aim to make code more readable and easier to maintain by establishing a consistent style that all programmers can follow. Some of the key features of Betty Style include:

- Four-space indentation
- No more than 80 characters per line
- Use of descriptive variable and function names
- Consistent use of whitespace and brackets

Adhering to Betty Style can make your code easier to read and understand, which can save time and reduce errors when working on large codebases.```
